*NYC Taxi Trip Prediction*
This project predicts NYC taxi trip fares using a preprocessed sample of the NYC Taxi dataset. The dataset is stored on Google Drive and can be directly accessed using this notebook. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model development using Spark ML pipelines. The notebook is designed to run in a self-contained manner, downloading the preprocessed dataset, loading it into the environment, and performing the modeling steps. This project is suitable for learning regression modeling, feature selection, and handling large datasets efficiently.
